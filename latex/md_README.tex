This is a very simple set of C++ libraries for Firestorm Robotics (FRC 6341) and indeed anybody else. Written by the coders at Firestorm Robotics. ~\newline
 Support for Windows and Mac\+OS not guaranteed -\/ we\textquotesingle{}re largely a Linux team

To use\+: Download \href{https://firestorm-robotics-code.github.io/FirestormRoboticsLibrary/use.py}{\texttt{ use.\+py}} and place it in your robot project\textquotesingle{}s root directory (NOT under src!) and add 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{task\ loadFirestormRoboticsLibrary(type:\ Exec)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ commandLine\ 'python',\ 'use.py'}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{build.dependsOn\ loadFirestormRoboticsLibrary}

\end{DoxyCode}
 to {\ttfamily build.\+gradle} in your robot project. ~\newline
 {\ttfamily use.\+py} will automatically check the library version and download it if necessary every time a build runs on wifi. ~\newline
 From there, just {\ttfamily \#include \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}FRL/whatever/whatever.\+hpp\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} to use libraries.

Everything is kept under the namespace {\ttfamily frl} -\/ theoretically. In practice almost nothing is. This is a Work In Progress.
